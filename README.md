# Humanity

Idea for an extremely complicated RTS game that will probably never be made.

## Premise

The player must guide their nation through 12,000 years of history, from a small tribe to a complex modern state. Population growth and technological advancement occur somewhat organically, although the player can make decisions that affect both. There are no specialist units like villagers, infantry, calvary or artillery --- each individual can develop specialist skills and be trained to perform various roles. Exploration takes place on a global scale, limited by the ability to find food, water and shelter.

## The map

The game map is a geographically-accurate map of the world. Varying levels of zoom allow for increasingly granular control. When zoomed in to a high level, adjacent tiles are loaded as the player scrolls toward them.

## The unit

The game has only one unit, which is called a 'tribesperson', 'subject' or 'citizen' (and other such names), depending on the organisation of the society. The unit can assigned and reassigned to various functions, such as resource-gathering, farming, construction, soldiering and exploration, but becomes more effective and efficient through a combination of aptitude and experience.
